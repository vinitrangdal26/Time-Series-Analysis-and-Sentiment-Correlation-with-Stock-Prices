# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Sentiment-Correlation-with-Stock-Prices
This project explores Netflix's stock price movements using advanced time series analysis, sentiment analysis from external sources, and correlation studies with other stocks and indices. The goal is to uncover trends, seasonality, and the potential relationship between public sentiment and stock performance.

# Key Components:
Time Series Decomposition: Break down stock price data into its trend, seasonal patterns, and residual components.
Moving Averages and Volatility Analysis: Identify long-term trends and periods of high volatility.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment from social media/news data and compare it to stock prices.
Correlation with Other Stocks: Study Netflix’s correlation with other companies' stocks and broader indices.
Project Structure
Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting columns (e.g., dates) into appropriate formats.
Plot basic time series graphs to visualize the stock prices and volume movements over time.
Time Series Analysis:

Decomposition: Break the stock price into trend, seasonality, and noise components to better understand underlying patterns.
Moving Averages: Compute short- and long-term moving averages (e.g., 7-day, 30-day) to smooth out fluctuations.
Volatility: Calculate rolling volatility using standard deviation to identify periods of heightened market uncertainty.
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:

Use ACF and PACF plots to examine lagged relationships between stock prices. These tools help in identifying patterns and periodicity within the stock price data.
Sentiment Analysis:

# Data Collection:
Scrape relevant news articles or social media posts related to the company using APIs (e.g., Tweepy for Twitter, News API for news headlines).
Sentiment Scoring: Apply sentiment analysis using pre-trained models (such as VADER or TextBlob) to classify the scraped data into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
Correlation with Stock Prices: Compare sentiment trends with stock price movements to examine if news/public perception impacts price volatility.
Correlation with Other Stocks:

Collect stock data of related companies (such as Disney, Amazon) or broader indices (NASDAQ, S&P 500) for the same period.
Analyze correlation matrices to assess how the stock of interest moves in relation to these other companies or market indicators.

# Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Initial Exploration
Begin by preparing the stock price dataset (e.g., handling missing data and ensuring proper formatting of dates and numerical values).
Visualize the time series to gain initial insights into the behavior of stock prices over time.
2. Time Series Decomposition
Break down the stock price data into three key components:
Trend: Indicates the overall direction of the stock price over time.
Seasonality: Identifies any periodic patterns in the data, such as seasonal increases in stock prices during specific times of the year.
Residual (Noise): Represents the random fluctuations that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonal components.
3. Moving Averages and Volatility
Compute moving averages over different windows (e.g., 7-day and 30-day) to smooth the data and highlight long-term price trends.
Calculate the stock price’s volatility using rolling standard deviations to pinpoint periods of significant price fluctuations or market uncertainty.
4. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation
Generate ACF and PACF plots to uncover potential lag effects in the stock prices, helping to identify cyclical patterns or mean-reverting behavior.
5. Sentiment Analysis
Data Collection: Scrape textual data (news headlines, tweets, etc.) related to the company using APIs.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply sentiment analysis tools (such as VADER or TextBlob) to evaluate whether news articles or social media posts are positive, neutral, or negative.
Stock Price Comparison: Compare the sentiment scores with stock price movements to identify if there's a relationship between public perception and stock price changes.
6. Correlation with Other Stocks
Collect stock data from related companies or broader market indices.
Compute and visualize the correlation between Netflix's stock price and the prices of other companies (e.g., Amazon, Disney) to evaluate whether similar market forces are affecting these stocks.
Insights and Further Exploration
Seasonality and Trend Insights:

By decomposing the time series, you can observe whether stock prices exhibit seasonal patterns, such as higher prices during the holiday season or after earnings announcements.
Sentiment Analysis:

By analyzing sentiment from news or social media posts, you can explore whether positive sentiment drives stock prices upward or if negative sentiment correlates with stock price drops. This can help identify emotional or psychological market drivers.
Volatility and Sentiment:

Investigating the relationship between sentiment trends and volatility can reveal whether market sentiment is a key driver of price fluctuations.
Correlations with Other Stocks:

Understanding how the stock correlates with broader indices or related companies can provide insights into whether stock movements are company-specific or part of broader market trends.
